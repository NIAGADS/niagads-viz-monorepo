# TODOs and FIXMEs

## `/components/sidebar`

Commented out sidebar navigation button b/c it doesn't work and it hides the whole side bar, including the navigation.
This is an effect of removing the client side-states at the page level.

Review whether media queries are sufficient or if we want to reinstate this.  Will it work w/new record/layout.tsx?

## action button css

resolve action-button.css and record.css

## create genomicsdb issue tracking project on github and update sample.env.local
